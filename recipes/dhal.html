    <h1>A delicious, simple dhal anyone can make.</h1>
    <img src="dhal.jpg" alt="Dhal">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This version of dhal requires a bunch of spices, some tomates and lentils and that's it. <br>
        The prep work is chopping and blending. After that, the dhal just needs to simmer and it's ready to eat. <br>
        I suggest you wait until the next day before eating it, but it can be eaten right as it's done and it's
        delicious.
